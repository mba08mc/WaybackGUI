# WaybackGUI
 A simple application that lets you quickly access an archived site without having to type in long urls or use their slow website

This small application lets you quickly load a website for the wayback machine.

Since it's fully coded in Python it should support all OSes.
There is also a macOS application for Mac users (obviously) which removes the need to use terminal to launch the application.

The app is very barebones right now and I'll probably update it to add more features in the future.

I don't care if you reuse the code in your own projects as long as you credit me in your work.

Hope you enjoy this app :)
